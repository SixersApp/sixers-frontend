# sixers

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

-   [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
-   [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Riverpod

Make sure when you are writing riverpod/freezed/json_serializable code to run the build_runner using dart run build_runner watch.

## Supabase

Start supabase locally using the CLI. It should give you an output with all of the keys and links you need. Get the API URL and the anon key. In the API URL, if you are trying to use it from an emulator replace the 127.0.0.1 with either your pc's ip address or 10.0.2.2. These will allow you to connect from flutter (my pc's ip worked better).
